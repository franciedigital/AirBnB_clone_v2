# SQL AICHEMY
SQLAlchemy is a Python library that provides a set of high-level tools and abstractions for working with relational databases. It supports a variety of database management systems, including PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, and Oracle.

One of the key features of SQLAlchemy is its Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system, which allows developers to interact with a database using Python objects rather than writing SQL queries directly. With an ORM, you can define classes that represent tables in the database and create, read, update, and delete records using methods on those classes.
# MYSQL STATEMENT SYNTAX
MySQL is a relational database management system that uses SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the database. Here are some of the basic syntax rules for writing SQL statements in MySQL:

Statements must end with a semicolon (;).

Keywords are not case-sensitive, but it is a convention to write them in uppercase to improve readability.

String values must be enclosed in single quotes ('value').

Identifiers such as table and column names can be enclosed in backticks (identifier), but it is optional unless the identifier conflicts with a MySQL keyword.

Comments can be added using either -- or # to start a single-line comment, or /* */ to enclose a multi-line comment.
